| I found the exact (Animated GIF) image I had used over half a decade ago. This will be the banner for the guestbook, for now. [animated-book-image.gif](/animated-book-image.gif) |

This is a guestbook, where people who visit my repository can sign, ask questions, and give feedback. As of 2023, Monday, April 24th, I am getting very little interaction on my profile, so I wanted to see how many people are willing to post. I also like the idea of having a guestbook.

There are multiple guestbooks (but not too many, only 4) for different subjects. They include:

1. General
2. Off topic
3. Follow for follow
4. Promotion - Show off your repositories (limit: 6 repos per user/day)

## License disclaimer
