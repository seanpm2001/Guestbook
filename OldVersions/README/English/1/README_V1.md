This is a guestbook, where people who visit my repository can sign, ask questions, and give feedback. As of 2023, Monday, April 24th, I am getting very little interaction on my profile, so I wanted to see how many people are willing to post. I also like the idea of having a guestbook.

There are multiple guestbooks (but not too many) for different subjects.
